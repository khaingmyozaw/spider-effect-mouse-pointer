### 📐 Euclidean Distance Formula

The **Euclidean distance** between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` in 2D space is calculated as:

```
Distance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
```


#### ✅ Example

To calculate the distance between points `(4, 4)` and `(8, 8)`:

```
Distance = √((8 - 4)² + (8 - 4)²)
         = √(16 + 16)
         = √32
         ≈ 5.66
```

Hope you guys OK.
